# Introduction

In this section, **Language** **Basics**, after each lesson, we will complete the associated Koan Lab installed in the  below Koans project

Each Koan will contain exercises similar to the topic of the Basic lesson.

 

A Koan is essentially a simple problem where programmer is asked to “fill in the blanks”.

They look a lot like unit tests and will be immediately familiar to those programmers that are used to writing them

 

By following along the path set before you, you will touch on all the major aspects of the language.

The koans’ incremental, interactive approach to learning the language will help make the transition feel natural.

By the time you are finished with them, Java will not be so mysterious at all.

# Installation

If not dont already set your Environmental variables to point to your JDK 8

- Append Java 8 **bin** to **path** e.g. “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.XXX\bin”
- Set **JAVA_HOME** environmental Variable to java 8 e.g “C:\Program Files\Java\\jdk1.8.XXX”

Clone or download the repo <https://github.com/roryp/java-koans> and open a command prompt
Run “run.bat” in the “koans” directory  – \koans\run.bat

The goal is to edit and replace all the “__” for each exercise with the correct answer

You need to solve the problem to get to the next level.

- For example: The first level is to fine the file AboutKoans.java:
- Delete line 11 and change line’s 16 variable to be false
- Save the file
- The Koans window will then evaluate it and take you to the next sequence – AboutAssertions
- Open AboutAssertions and fix line 13 – replace the __ with true.
- Save the file

 

After all the tests in a file are passing, the run script will automatically begin testing the next file in the koans sequence.

Remember to follow the lab instructions on which Koan to complete.
